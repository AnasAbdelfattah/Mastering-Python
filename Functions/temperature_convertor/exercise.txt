Write a function that will receive as an input argument a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
and will return the temperature in both degrees Celsius and Kelvin. 
The conversion factors are C = (F â€“ 32) * 5/9 and K = C + 273.15.
Write a script (i.e. which is the scratch file as we know in Pycharm) to use the developed function. 
The used function is in a separate script other than the main script, you should import it first.
