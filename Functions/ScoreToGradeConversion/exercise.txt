Write a program that takes a list of students’ scores in an exam (stored in an array, i.e. list) 
and computes their grades. (A >=90%,  90>B>=80, 80>C>=70, 70>D>=60, 60>F) and store them in an array.
The program should make use of a function scoreToGrade which takes in one score 
and returns the corresponding grade. import this separate script to your main script.
 Note that in case that this script is your main script, use: 
if __name__ == ‘main’: 


Example: 
Input:    	A= [74 82 41 55 68 98]    			
Output:  	G= [C B F D C A]
