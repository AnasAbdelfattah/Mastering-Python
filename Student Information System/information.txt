  --------------------------------- Student Information System ---------------------------------

Create a Python program that manages information about students without using classes or file handling. Implement the following features:

    Student Data:
        Use lists to store information about students.
         Each student should be represented as a dictionary with attributes like 
         name , id, courses (a list of course names), and grades (a list of corresponding grades).


    Functions:
        Implement functions to:
            Add a new student to the system.
            Remove a student from the system based on their ID.
            Display information about a specific student based on their ID.
            Display a list of all students and their information.

    Grades Calculation:
        Implement a function to calculate the average grade for a student.

    User Interface:
        Create a simple command-line interface that allows the user to interact with the program. Include options to add a student, remove a student, display student information, display all students, and calculate the average grade for a specific student.

    Data Validation:
        Ensure that the user provides valid input when interacting with the program. For example, check if the user enters a valid grade when adding a student.

    Documentation and Comments:
        Provide clear documentation for your functions. Include comments where necessary to explain your code.
